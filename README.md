# -Worldwide-Startup-Statistics---Factors-Impacting-Success-Failure
Problem Definition:
Startups have emerged as a crucial part of the global economy, and they play a critical role in creating jobs, driving innovation, and generating economic growth. However, the success rate of startups is low, and most of them fail within the first few years. Therefore, it is essential to understand the factors affecting the success or failure of startups to make informed decisions and improve their chances of success. The objective of the project is to predict the success or failure of startups. Research questions include the success rate of startups globally, common reasons for startup failure, and critical factors that contribute to the success of startups.


The project aims to answer the following questions:
•	What is the success rate of startups globally, and how does it vary across different regions?
•	What are the common reasons for startup failure, and how do they differ across various industries?
•	What are the critical factors that contribute to the success of startups, and how do they vary across regions and industries?
